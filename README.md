# CI-CD
This repository includes components, key tools and CI CD pipeline workflow and its benefits.

A CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is a series of steps that automate software development, testing, and deployment. The goal is to ensure that code changes are reliable, quickly integrated, and automatically deployed, reducing human error, and improving speed and consistency.

# Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is the practice of merging code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by building the code and running tests.

Objective: CI helps detect and fix integration bugs early, and ensure that new code works well with the existing codebase.

Key Components:
1. Version Control System (VCS) - Code changes are submitted (committed) to a VCS like Git, often through a feature branch.
2. Automated Build - Each commit triggers an automated build to compile and assemble the code.
3. Automated Testing - Unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes static analysis checks are run to validate the code.
4. Feedback - If any test or build fails, the developer receives immediate feedback to fix issues quickly.

# Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery builds on CI by automatically preparing code for release to a staging or production environment. While CI ends with automated testing, CD extends to deploying tested code to a staging environment for final checks.

Objective: The goal of CD is to ensure that code can be safely and quickly deployed to production at any time.

Key Components:
1. Environment Consistency - The pipeline includes environment-specific configurations to ensure consistency between staging and production.
2. Release Automation - Code is packaged and deployed to staging environments.
3. Approval Gates - CD may include a manual approval step before final deployment, especially in more controlled environments.

# Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further by automatically releasing code changes to production without manual intervention.

Objective: To reduce the time from code commit to production as much as possible, ensuring that users get the latest updates instantly.

Key Components:
1. Automated Deployment to Production - Every change that passes tests and validations is deployed directly to production.
2. Monitoring and Rollbacks - Continuous monitoring is critical to detect and rollback faulty deployments quickly.

# CI CD Pipeline Steps
1. Code Commit and Push:
* Developers write code locally and commit it to the repository (Git, SVN, etc.). This triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Automated Build:
* The code is compiled and built into an executable, or packages (such as Docker images) are created.
* Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions.
3. Automated Testing:
* Unit Testing: Testing individual units of code.
* Integration Testing: Ensuring that different modules work together.
* Regression Testing: after bug is fixed, will do this testing to see if everything is working fine or not
* End-to-End Testing: Testing the application from a user’s perspective.
* Static Code Analysis: Code quality and security scans to enforce coding standards.
* Tools: JUnit, Selenium, SonarQube, pytest, etc.
4. Artifact Management:
* Once code passes tests, it’s packaged and stored in an artifact repository, like Nexus or Artifactory, to keep versioned builds available for deployment.
5. Deployment to Staging:
* Artifacts are deployed to a staging environment to mimic production, giving teams a final check before production deployment.
* Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CodeDeploy, Ansible.
6. Approval Gate (Optional):
* Many organizations use an approval step where stakeholders manually review and approve changes before deployment to production.
* Tools: Built-in gate options within CI/CD tools (like Jenkins' pipelines or GitLab's approvals).
7. Automated Deployment to Production:
* In Continuous Deployment, if all tests pass, code is deployed to production without manual intervention.
* Tools: Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or deployment automation in tools like Kubernetes and Docker.
8. Monitoring and Logging:
* Monitoring the production environment ensures the application performs as expected.
* Logging captures runtime issues or errors, and monitoring (with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog) watches performance metrics.
* If issues are detected, rollback mechanisms can revert to the previous stable version.

## Key Tools in CI/CD Pipelines
1. Source Control: Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
2. Build Automation: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions
3. Testing: JUnit, Selenium, PyTest, SonarQube, Postman (for APIs)
4. Artifact Management: Nexus, Artifactory
5. Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, AWS CodePipeline, Spinnaker
6. Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog

## CI/CD Workflow
1. Code pushed to repository.
2. CI triggered: Automated build and tests run.
3. Artifact created and stored if all tests pass.
4. CD triggered: Artifact deployed to a staging environment.
5. Approval/Review (if needed).
6. Automated deployment to production if all gates are cleared.
7. Monitoring in production: Logs and metrics are observed.
8. Alerting and Rollback if any issue is detected.

# Benefits of a CI/CD Pipeline
* Faster and reliable releases: Small, frequent releases help spot and fix issues early.
* Improved Code Quality: Automated testing and code analysis ensure only high-quality code is deployed.
* Reduced Manual Work: Automation reduces human error and allows teams to focus on development.
* Better Collaboration: Consistent and shared repositories, along with automated processes, help keep teams aligned.
